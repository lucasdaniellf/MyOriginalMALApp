My unofficial MAL App


My original MAL app. I made it based on the the official MAL app, just so I could use what I had studied from Java and Android Studio. I didn't use an account manager since
I didn't get the hang of it, so the user info is stored locally. I took the client id from the code so if you want to run the project in android studio you have to register your own client id in the MyAnimeList site.
